## gogcli v0.10.0 Installed

- Installed via `brew install steipete/tap/gogcli`
- Full Google Workspace CLI: Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Slides, Sheets, Contacts, Tasks, etc.
- **Status**: Needs OAuth2 credentials from Google Cloud Console before first use
- **Next step**: Robel needs to click the OpenClaw Chrome extension icon so I can navigate Google Cloud Console to create OAuth2 credentials
- Alternatively, Robel can manually create credentials at https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

## Context: Robel sent a tweet from @steipete (Peter Steinberger, OpenClaw creator) announcing gogcli v0.10.0. Asked me to install it. Done. Then asked if I could set up OAuth2 via the OpenClaw browser — Chrome extension relay needs manual activation (click the 🦞 icon).

## OpenClaw v2026.2.13 Released

Discovered during heartbeat check. Key changes:
- Discord: Voice messages with waveform previews
- Discord: Configurable presence status/activity
- Outbound: Write-ahead delivery queue (crash recovery)
- Auto-reply: Implicit reply threading
- Telegram: Command cap at 100
- Hugging Face: First-class provider support
- GLM-5 model support added

## Chrome Extension Relay Attached

- Successfully attached Chrome extension relay using Peekaboo pixel click.
- **Workflow**: `peekaboo click --app "Google Chrome" --coords 1718,93`.
- **Verified**: `browser action:tabs profile:chrome` now returns active tabs.
- **Status**: Ready to proceed with Google Cloud Console OAuth2 setup.

## Heartbeat Maintenance

- Updated MEMORY.md with v2026.2.13 release notes and gogcli installation
- ClawHub site is JS-rendered SPA, couldn't scrape content via web_fetch
- Workspace has uncommitted files (agents/, chrome-toolbar.png, memory/2026-02-14-*.md, memory/guidelines/)
- Branch is 1 commit ahead of origin/main
