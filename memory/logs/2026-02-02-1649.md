## Conversation Summary

assistant: Settings didn't change — looks like the command didn't actually run. Can you open Terminal and paste this:

```bash
sudo pmset -a sleep 0 disksleep 0 displaysleep 0
```

It'll ask for your password, then should complete silently. Let me know when it's done and I'll verify.
user: how do I exit from this page on termina?
[message_id: 5a6bb509-0d53-49c7-9ef3-26efcd0ab206]
assistant: Press `q` to exit.

(You're probably in a pager like `less` or a man page.)
user: roba@Robels-Mac-mini ~ % sudo pmset -a sleep 0 disksleep 0 displaysleep Password: Usage: pmset <options> See pmset(1) for details: 'man pmset'

assistant: Command got cut off when pasting. Try typing it out manually, or copy this version (all one line):

```
sudo pmset -a sleep 0
```

Hit enter, type your password, then run:

```
sudo pmset -a disksleep 0
```

Then:

```
sudo pmset -a displaysleep 0
```

Breaking it into three commands avoids the paste issue.
assistant: Something's mangling the paste. Type this one manually (don't paste):

```
sudo pmset -a sleep 0
```

Just that — 6 words. Enter your password when prompted, then tell me what happens.
user: here it is roba@Robels-Mac-mini ~ % sudo pmset -a sleep 0 Password: roba@Robels-Mac-mini ~ % sudo pmset -a disksleep 0 roba@Robels-Mac-mini ~ % sudo pmset -a displaysleep 0 roba@Robels-Mac-mini ~ %

assistant: All set — everything's at 0 now. This Mac won't sleep anymore, so I'll be reachable 24/7.

What did you need last night?
user: is telegram working?
[message_id: ec9673c1-bd23-4cf7-9d2b-de840d2157de]
assistant: Telegram is configured and enabled. Bot token is set, plugin is on.

To test it: message the bot directly on Telegram. Since `dmPolicy` is set to `"pairing"`, you'll need to start a chat with it first — just send it any message and it should respond.

What's the bot's username? I can tell you exactly what to search for in Telegram.
user: I sent a message but got no response
[message_id: 5f15bbc0-b9b9-4e1c-8226-9281e1787793]
assistant: Gateway is running and Telegram shows as OK. Let me check the logs for what happened when you messaged:
assistant: That log dump is weird. Let me check the actual logs differently:
assistant: No Telegram errors in the logs. The config has `dmPolicy: "pairing"` — which means you need to be approved before I can respond.

Let me check if there's a pending pairing request from your message:
user: what does this mean? speak in english please
