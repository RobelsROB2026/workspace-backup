## 02:10 AM - Nightly Blog Writer Success
- **Task**: Texas Bonds Blog Writer (cron job)
- **Status**: Completed successfully (runtime ~10m)
- **Result**: 6 new blog posts created and pushed to `feature/apply-page` branch
- **Posts**: Motor Vehicle Dealer Bond, Notary Public Bond, Freight Broker Bond (BMC-84), Bonded Title (Step-by-Step, Boats, Motorcycles)

## Scheduling Hybrid System Test
- ✅ **TEST PASSED**: The launchd + OpenClaw cron hybrid system successfully triggered and executed the 2 AM blog writer job. This confirms the workaround for the internal scheduler bug is working.

## 04:50 AM - Heartbeat Maintenance
- Fixed launchd PATH bug in all three plist files (`com.openclaw.blog-writer.plist`, `com.openclaw.update-check.plist`, `com.openclaw.weekly-improvement.plist`)
- Issue: `env: node: No such file or directory` in logs
- Fix: Added `EnvironmentVariables` with PATH including `/opt/homebrew/bin`
- Reloaded all agents via `launchctl unload/load`

## 04:58 AM - Second Blog Run Completed
- 5 additional posts: auto auction dealer bond, salvage dealer license, contractor bonds, collection agency bond, mortgage broker bond
- Total blog count now: 16 posts

## 07:39 AM - Robel's SEO Directive
**New requirement for nightly blog runs:**
- Do keyword research BEFORE writing
- Search Google for target keyword, analyze competition
- SKIP if big players (SuretyBonds.com, JW Surety, Bryant Surety) dominate top 5
- WRITE only low-competition, long-tail, local-intent keywords
- Report must include: keywords researched, what was skipped vs written and why

Updated cron job `9af01fc8-d178-4b56-a596-f4dee0fd25b5` with new instructions.
