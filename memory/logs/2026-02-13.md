## Skill Audit & Improvement

Based on OpenAI's article on skill design patterns, audited and improved all 15 skills.

### Patterns Applied

1. **Routing logic in descriptions** — "Use when / Don't use when" format
2. **Negative examples** — Explicit "don't call this skill when..." cases
3. **Overlap clarification** — Tables showing which tool to use for related tasks

### Skills Updated

**Built-in (will need reapplication after OpenClaw updates):**
- peekaboo — Added macOS-only context, browser/CLI overlap clarification
- nano-banana-pro — Clarified generation vs analysis distinction
- gemini — Explained cost optimization use case (Opus delegates grunt work)
- github — Distinguished platform ops from code work
- 1password — Added security rules, "don't store secrets" guidance
- coding-agent — Clarified when to delegate vs do it myself
- weather — Added limitations for historical/radar data
- clawhub — Distinguished from skill-creator
- apple-notes — Added Apple ecosystem constraints
- blogwatcher — Added RSS-only limitation
- healthcheck — Added remote access safety warning
- nano-pdf — Clarified edit vs create/extract
- skill-creator — Distinguished from clawhub

**Custom (persistent):**
- gitclaw — Added conflict warnings for existing git remotes
- automation-workflows — Shortened description, distinguished from cron/heartbeat

### Key Insight

The description field is routing logic, not marketing copy. When I see a skill list, the description is my decision boundary for whether to load the full SKILL.md.

### Persistence

- **Built-in skills**: In `/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/openclaw/skills/` — will be overwritten on OpenClaw updates. Reapply if needed.
- **Custom skills**: In workspace (`skills/gitclaw/`, `skills/automation-workflows/`) — persistent.

Decision: Keep local only, don't upstream. Reapply after updates if needed.

## Browser Workflow Clarification

**Key lesson:** I forgot I have my own X account (@RobelAlema63562) logged into Chrome. Should use Chrome extension relay (profile: chrome) for X, Gmail, GitHub — not the isolated openclaw browser.

**Workflow documented in TOOLS.md:**
1. Use Peekaboo to click the OpenClaw extension button in Chrome toolbar
2. Once attached, use `browser` tool with `profile=chrome`
3. For sites where I have logins → chrome profile
4. For generic browsing → openclaw profile

**Challenge:** Chrome toolbar icons aren't well-exposed to accessibility APIs. Peekaboo can click by coordinates but it's tricky. May need Robel to click the extension button manually in some cases.

## Topic Separation

Robel wants distinct conversations for distinct topics (e.g., "improving ROB" vs "selling bonds").

**Agreed approach:**
- Use `/new` when switching topics for a clean break
- Use sub-agents (`sessions_spawn`) for isolated workstreams
- MEMORY.md provides continuity across sessions

---

## Lead Generation System (Pending)

Robel wants automated monitoring for people looking to buy surety bonds.

**Proposed system:**
- Monitor: Reddit (r/DMV, r/legaladvice, r/Texas, etc.), X/Twitter, Google
- Search terms: "bonded title Texas", "need surety bond", "dealer bond", etc.
- Filter for intent signals (questions, "need help")
- Alert Robel with link, snippet, suggested response

**Status:** Awaiting Robel's confirmation on:
- Bond types to prioritize
- Delivery preference (digest vs real-time)
- Whether to include draft responses

## OpenClaw v2026.2.12 Released

Key improvements:
- **Cron reliability fixes** — Safe to migrate back from launchd workaround
- **Opus 4.6 forward-compat** — Ready for next model
- **Security hardening** — SSRF policy, untrusted web content wrapping
- **Local timezone logs** — `openclaw logs --local-time`

Updated `memory/openclaw-tips.md` with these notes.
