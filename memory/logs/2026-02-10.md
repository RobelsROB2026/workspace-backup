# 2026-02-10 Session Log

## News Checked
- TechMeme digest completed at 12:12 PM
- Top stories: xAI co-founder Tony Wu resigned, UK CMA app store commitments, Spotify record growth, OpenAI testing ChatGPT ads, Runway $315M Series E

## RockLikeAgencyBonds Progress
- Blog CTAs added and pushed: StickyCTA (sidebar), TopBanner, mobile bottom bar
- **Issue identified**: `/apply` page doesn't exist yet - CTAs link to it but page is missing
- Robel asked about this - needs to be built

## Scheduling System
- Diagnosed OpenClaw cron scheduler bug (recurring jobs don't auto-fire)
- Implemented hybrid workaround:
  - launchd plists for exact-time tasks (blog writer 2 AM, weekly improvement Sun 3 AM, update check Mon 9 AM)
  - HEARTBEAT.md for flexible periodic checks
  - OpenClaw cron `--at` for one-shot reminders
- **Tonight's 2 AM blog run is first real test**

## Workspace Backup Issue
- Git remote `RobelsRob2026/workspace-backup` not found
- SSH auth works (authenticated as `RobelsROB2026`)
- Repo may not exist on GitHub - needs to be created or URL fixed
- GitClaw skill has setup instructions

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Create /apply page for bonds site
- [ ] Fix workspace backup (create repo or fix remote URL)
- [ ] Monitor 2 AM blog writer run tomorrow morning
