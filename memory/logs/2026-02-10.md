# 2026-02-10 Session Log

## News Checked
- TechMeme digest completed at 12:12 PM
- Top stories: xAI co-founder Tony Wu resigned, UK CMA app store commitments, Spotify record growth, OpenAI testing ChatGPT ads, Runway $315M Series E

## RockLikeAgencyBonds Progress
- Blog CTAs added and pushed: StickyCTA (sidebar), TopBanner, mobile bottom bar
- **Issue identified**: `/apply` page doesn't exist yet - CTAs link to it but page is missing
- Robel asked about this - needs to be built

## Scheduling System
- Diagnosed OpenClaw cron scheduler bug (recurring jobs don't auto-fire)
- Implemented hybrid workaround:
  - launchd plists for exact-time tasks (blog writer 2 AM, weekly improvement Sun 3 AM, update check Mon 9 AM)
  - HEARTBEAT.md for flexible periodic checks
  - OpenClaw cron `--at` for one-shot reminders
- **Tonight's 2 AM blog run is first real test**

## Workspace Backup Issue
- Git remote `RobelsRob2026/workspace-backup` not found
- SSH auth works (authenticated as `RobelsROB2026`)
- Repo may not exist on GitHub - needs to be created or URL fixed
- GitClaw skill has setup instructions

## Evening Session (6:30 PM - 7:15 PM)

### Workspace Organization
- Created `projects/` folder to separate business projects from ROB self-improvement
- `projects/rocklike-bonds/` for bond business notes, content, research
- Root workspace remains ROB-focused (SOUL.md, MEMORY.md, memory/, etc.)

### Git Workflow Clarified
- **Projects (RockLikeAgencyBonds, etc.):** Always use PRs, never push directly to main
- **My workspace (workspace-backup):** Direct push to main is fine
- Updated TOOLS.md with this rule

### gh CLI Setup ✓
- Created fine-grained personal access token via browser
- Token name: `gh-cli`
- Permissions: Contents (R/W), Pull requests (R/W), Metadata (R)
- Expires: Mar 12, 2026
- Authenticated gh CLI with token, set protocol to SSH
- Ready to create PRs on projects

### Heartbeat Checks (7:08-7:12 PM)
- **Email:** 8 unread, mostly GitHub notifications from my own setup activities (token created, SSH key added). Nothing urgent.
- **Calendar:** No events for Feb 11 (tomorrow). Calendar is empty.
- **Git:** Workspace committed and pushed

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Create /apply page for bonds site (waiting for Robel to add me to Vercel)
- [x] Fix workspace backup - DONE (created repo, pushed)
- [x] Set up gh CLI for PRs - DONE
- [ ] Monitor 2 AM blog writer run tomorrow morning

## Late Night Session (10:45 PM - 11:11 PM)

### GitHub Access Confirmed
- SSH push to `rodejene/RockLikeAgencyBonds` works ✓
- `gh` CLI API token is scoped to my repos only (can't create PRs via API on Robel's repos)
- Workaround: I push branches, Robel creates PRs from GitHub UI

### RockLikeAgencyBonds Status
- `feature/apply-page` branch ready with /apply page commit
- PR link: https://github.com/rodejene/RockLikeAgencyBonds/compare/main...feature/apply-page
- Robel will create PR and merge

### Browser/Peekaboo Notes
- Chrome extension relay not connected (can't use profile=chrome)
- OpenClaw managed browser (profile=openclaw) works but isn't logged into services
- Peekaboo can switch to Chrome and capture screenshots
- Need to click OpenClaw extension icon in Chrome toolbar to connect relay
