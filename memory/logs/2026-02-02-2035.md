## Conversation Summary

user: [Telegram Robel Alemayehu (@SerialHypnotist) id:393069019 2026-02-01 23:55 CST] So, I have an insurance agency. I sell insurance to truckers and trucking companies. Recently I got appointed to an MGA who gives me access to a bunch of bonds surety bonds. I’m planning on selling last title bonds in Texas commission is about 30% and a lot of these ones are only $100 so 30 bucks per sale do you think it will make sense to do Google ads for this business? Can you research this for me?

user: [Telegram Robel Alemayehu (@SerialHypnotist) id:393069019 +1h 2026-02-02 12:12 CST] Hey
[message_id: 25]
assistant: Yo! Telegram's back up. 

On your lost title bond question from last night — I tried to research it but web search isn't configured yet (need a Brave API key). But here's my take based on what I know:

**The math is rough at $30/sale:**

- Insurance/surety keywords on Google Ads typically run $5-15+ per click
- Even with a solid 5% conversion rate, you're looking at $100-300 to acquire one customer
- That's a loss on every sale

**When it *might* work:**

- If you can get hyper-local/long-tail keywords cheap ("lost title bond Houston" etc.)
- If these customers come back for other bonds or insurance products (lifetime value play)
- If you build SEO/content instead of paying per click

**Better angles to consider:**

- Partner with used car dealers, mechanics, tow yards — they see people with title issues daily
- Facebook/local community groups (cheaper reach, people asking "how do I get a title")
- SEO blog content targeting "how to get a title without title in Texas"

Want me to dig deeper once I get search working, or talk through any of these angles?
user: [Telegram Robel Alemayehu (@SerialHypnotist) id:393069019 +3m 2026-02-02 12:16 CST] That’s a long term play. I like it. Before we do that, can we investigate the other surety bond types ? They have more than 7000 bonds. The mga is propeller bonds

[message_id: 29]
assistant: Not rate limited — just took a sec to fetch their site. Let me dig deeper into their bond catalog.
user: [Telegram Robel Alemayehu (@SerialHypnotist) id:393069019 +12m 2026-02-02 12:31 CST] Ok

assistant: Ah yeah, that was a rate limit on the API key — 30k input tokens/min on Opus. That's the Anthropic limit for your tier, not a Telegram issue. It passed after a minute.

Anyway — found some promising stuff on Propeller:

**Contract Bonds** (bigger $$$):
- Bid Bonds
- Performance Bonds
- Payment Bonds
- Subdivision Bonds

**Commercial Bonds** (your wheelhouse):
- **Freight Broker BMC-84 Bonds** ← this is your trucking niche!
- Auto Dealer Bonds
- Contractor License Bonds
- Cannabis Bonds
- ERISA Bonds
- Notary Bonds

Let me dig into the ones that could actually move the needle commission-wise:
user: [Telegram Robel Alemayehu (@SerialHypnotist) id:393069019 +20m 2026-02-02 14:16 CST] Ok. Feel free to investigate and let me know what you think would work. I want to find those bonds that have low competition on the keywords, but we’ll have a decent amount of premium to make sense for the CPC.
[message_id: 37]
assistant: Got it. This is a solid research project — let me dig in properly. I'll look for the sweet spot: niche bonds with decent premiums but lower search competition.
user: [Telegram Robel Alemayehu (@SerialHypnotist) id:393069019 +30s 2026-02-02 14:17 CST] By the way, if you need to use the web, just use Google Chrome on the computer. You have full access . This is your computer.

assistant: Oh nice — let me fire that up and do proper keyword research.
user: [Telegram Robel Alemayehu (@SerialHypnotist) id:393069019 +16m 2026-02-02 14:35 CST] I were able to fire it ?
