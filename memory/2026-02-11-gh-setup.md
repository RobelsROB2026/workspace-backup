Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
assistant: HEARTBEAT_OK
user: Pre-compaction memory flush. Store durable memories now (use memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md; create memory/ if needed). If nothing to store, reply with NO_REPLY.
assistant: NO_REPLY
user: [Telegram Robel Alemayehu (@SerialHypnotist) id:393069019 +58s 2026-02-10 19:13 CST] No need fore adding you to vercel now since I’ll approve and merge the PR
[message_id: 557]
assistant: Got it. I'll build the `/apply` page and submit a PR. You review and merge.
assistant: PR pushed. GitHub says:
https://github.com/rodejene/RockLikeAgencyBonds/pull/new/feature/apply-page

My `gh` token only has access to my repos, not rodejene's. You'll need to create/approve the PR from that link, or I can do it via browser.

**What's in the PR:**
- `/apply` page with lead capture form
- Fields: name, email, phone, bond type, state
- Vehicle info fields (conditionally shown for bonded titles)
- Success state after submission
- SEO metadata + sitemap update

Form submission is placeholder — needs backend integration.
