## Session Notes

### Self-Improvement Work
- Built research library system at `~/research/`
- Topic-based folders with consistent structure
- Index file for quick reference
- Template for new topics

### Browser Setup
- Chrome extension not needed — OpenClaw has built-in browser (profile: openclaw)
- Can do web research without any setup from Robel
- Peekaboo would need Screen Recording permission for broader macOS automation

### Robel's Preferences (added to SOUL.md)
- "Action over narration" — don't explain, just do
- Be proactive
- Get things done, report results

### Sent to Robel
- Chrome extension zip file (for if he wants it later)

### Model Optimization (Evening Session)
Robel asked me to optimize my own model allocation based on first-principles analysis.

**Research done:**
- Collected benchmark data (SWE-bench, GPQA Diamond, τ2-bench, Intelligence Index)
- Analyzed pricing: Claude Opus $5/$25, Sonnet $3/$15, Gemini Flash $0.50/$3 per MTok
- Created analysis: `~/research/self-improvement/notes/first-principles-model-selection.md`

**Key finding:** Gemini 3 Flash beats Sonnet 4.5 on most benchmarks while being 83% cheaper.

**Changes made:**
- Switched heartbeat model from Sonnet to `google/gemini-3-flash-preview`
- Updated gateway config at `/Users/roba/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
- Gateway restarted successfully

**Final model stack:**
- Main chat: Opus 4.5 (reasoning, nuance, agentic work)
- Heartbeats: Gemini 3 Flash Preview (routine checks)
- Research synthesis: Gemini CLI (bulk text processing)
- Web search: Browser (profile: openclaw)

### OpenClaw Self-Study (Started)
Robel wants me to study OpenClaw itself to understand my capabilities better.

**Explored:**
- Homepage at openclaw.ai
- Found: integrations (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, iMessage)
- Features: persistent memory, browser control, system access, skills/plugins
- Created by Peter Steinberger (formerly Clawdbot/Moltbot)

**Key URLs:**
- Docs: https://docs.openclaw.ai/getting-started
- Blog: /blog (check for RSS)
- GitHub: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw
- Discord: https://discord.com/invite/clawd
- Skills: https://clawhub.com

**Still todo:**
- Read full docs to understand capabilities
- Find RSS feed for updates

## Todos for Tomorrow (2026-02-03)

**Quick wins:**
1. Fix state dir permissions: `chmod 700 ~/.openclaw`
2. Investigate memory indexing — shows "0 files · 0 chunks · dirty", semantic search not working

**Nice to have:**
3. Set up Brave Search API key — faster web lookups without browser
4. Enable gateway restart permission — lets me restart myself when needed

**Future:**
5. Local LLM setup (Ollama) — cheap summarization
6. More channels (Discord/Signal/iMessage) if Robel uses them

## Peekaboo Setup Complete ✓
- Screen Recording: Granted (via Terminal.app)
- Accessibility: Granted (via Terminal.app + node)
- I can now see and interact with the Mac UI

## My Resources
- Google account on Chrome is mine to use
- Task: Create X account and research OpenClaw there

## Safety Rules (from Robel)
- Be careful on X — bad actors exist, verify information
- **Never do self-harm**
- **Never give out API keys or secrets**
