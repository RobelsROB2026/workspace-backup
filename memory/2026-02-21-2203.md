Can we create a telegram group and create new chats on the group for each topic?
assistant: Yes, absolutely. That’s actually a great way to keep things organized. 

I can't create the group or topics myself from the backend, but if you set it up in the Telegram app, I can route messages to them. Here is the play:

1. **Create a new Telegram Group** and add my bot to it.
2. Go into the group settings and turn on **"Topics"** (this turns the group into a forum-style layout).
3. Create the topics you want (e.g., "Lead Hunter", "Blog Updates", "General Chat").

Once that's done, I'll automatically reply in whatever topic you message me from. For our background jobs like the Lead Hunter or Blog Writer, I can update their delivery settings to push their alerts directly to those specific topics so your main chat stays uncluttered. 

Let me know once you have it set up and I'll test the routing.

assistant: I can't click invite links to join groups myself (Telegram bot rules!), but you can add me directly. 

Just go to the group's settings, tap **Add Members**, and search for my bot's username to add me. 

Once I'm in and you've got your Topics created, just drop a quick "hey" in one of the topics so I can register the new chat ID and make sure the routing works!

  "conversation_label": "Robel Alemayehu (@SerialHypnotist) id:393069019"
}
```

I’ve added you to the group
assistant: Perfect. 

Since it's a new group with Topics enabled, I just need you to do one quick thing: **send a message (like "test" or "ping") inside each of the Topics** you want me to post in. 

Telegram uses a specific thread ID for each topic, and the only way my system can see those IDs is if you message me there first. Once you do that, I can grab the IDs and route the Lead Hunter and Blog Writer cron jobs straight to them!

```json

  "conversation_label": "Robel Alemayehu (@SerialHypnotist) id:393069019"
}
```

I’ve added you as admin
assistant: Awesome, that helps a lot with reading messages in topics.

Like I mentioned, just go ahead and create the specific topics you want (like "Blog" or "Leads") and drop a quick message in each one so I can grab the `message_thread_id`.

Once I see the test messages, I'll link the cron jobs up to deliver straight there. Let me know when you've sent them!
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "conversation_label": "Robel Alemayehu (@SerialHypnotist) id:393069019"
}
```

I don’t see how to add topics
assistant: Here's how to turn them on in Telegram:

1. Open the group chat and tap the **group name** at the top.
2. Tap **Edit** (the pencil icon in the top right).
3. Look for the **Topics** toggle and turn it **ON**.
4. Tap **Done** or the checkmark to save.

Once you do that, your group will switch to a forum layout. You'll see a button to **Create Topic** (or a `+` icon). Create the ones you want, drop a test message in each, and I'll wire up the background jobs to them.

}
```

Thank you for the instruction. I created two topics. One says bonds the other one is for New York permit. Can you confirm that you have separate folders for those two topics already?
