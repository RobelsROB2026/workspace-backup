# AI Agents Weekly Research - 2026-02-22

## Overview
A consequential week in the agentic AI ecosystem, marked by major infrastructure updates for OpenClaw and the solidification of the "Agent Stack" following the February frontier model releases.

## Key Takeaways
1. **OpenClaw v2026.2.21 Released:** Native Gemini 3.1 support, major Discord/Telegram streaming improvements, and thread-bound subagents for Discord.
2. **The "Agent Stack" Solidified:** Architecture is shifting from model-centric to protocol-centric (MCP, AGENTS.md). Models (Opus 4.6, GPT-5.3) are now considered "swappable engines."
3. **Local LLM Advancements:** "Ouro" (looped inference reasoning model) and "FlashLM v5" (CPU-trained model beating GPU baselines) represent a surge in efficient local reasoning.
4. **Agent Governance & Safety:** Emergence of "OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications" and supply chain warnings (Cline/OpenClaw injection) signal a shift toward production-ready security.
